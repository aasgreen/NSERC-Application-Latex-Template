This is a template for NSERC applications for research, hopefully it is useful!
The only thing I did is redefine the margins to be the minimum 1.87 cm, as stipulated in the NSERC application guide.

I also put in a fancy header, so that 'Adam Green' appears on the top right of the document, out of the margins-- as specified in the NSERC application guide.

I haven't yet checked if the single spacing comes within the 6 lines/inch, but that is going to be the next thing I check.
